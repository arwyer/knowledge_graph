AT5G22510 has_phenotype In this mutant, the development of the photosynthetic apparatus was inhibited in the Suc+ medium, while the assimilation of nitrate was enhanced.
AT3G54110 has_phenotype Photosynthetic phenotype. Specifically there is a restriction in photorespiration with a decrease in the rate of oxidation of photorespiratory glycine in the mitochondrion. This change leads to an associated reduced photosynthetic carbon assimilation rate.
AT4G18780 has_phenotype Grown under normal conditions mutant plants show weaker or no wilting phenotype.  Mutant leaves become wilty after plants are transferred from normal conditions to higher transpiration conditions for 6 hrs, whereas wt plants did not show the leaf-wilting phenotype under the same conditions.  Mutants are more resistant to drought and to osmotic stresss in both germination and growth.  Transcription of stress-inducible marker genes (RD29A, P5CS and ABA2) during non-stress  conditions is induced in mutant plants.
AT1G16540 has_phenotype abscisic acid deficient, reduced level of endogenous ABA during various stages of plant and seed development, but relatively higher ABA content than other aba mutants; impaired in ABA biosynthesis, blocking the conversion of ABA-aldehyde to ABA; increased leaf transpiration rate, but relatively low rate of water loss than other aba mutants, which leads to a slightly wilty phenotype especially under low relative humidity and water stress; wilty phenotype can be restored to normal by spraying an ABA solution to the plants; reduced seed dormancy, fresh seeds germinate at high frequency, germinate in silique on plant at high relative humidity; decreased sensitivity to the presence of GA biosynthesis inhibitors such as paclobutrazol; reduced sensitivity to salt and osmotic stress during germination.
AT4G26080 has_phenotype mutant showed ABA-hypersensitive regulation of seed germination and root growth; increased sensitivity to salt and osmotic stress during germination; increased sensitivity to glucose during germination; reduced leaf transpiration rate; increased ABA-induced stomatal closure; stomatal responses to 0.5 mM H2O2 and Ca2+ as WT; WT sensitivity to GA, NAA and ACC; mutant plants had decreased ABA content in response to drought and ozone; increased ACC production in response to ozone.
AT5G45340 has_phenotype Higher survival rate than wild type after 14 days of water withholding. This phenotype is supported by the observation of a moderate suppression of transpiration in the mutant.
AT5G35220 has_phenotype Dual phenotype, reduced chlorophyll content and gravicurvature-defective. Significant increase in anthocyanin content, abnormal chloroplasts, reduced photosynthetic capacity. Severely reduced lamellae lipid membranes in the plastids. The mutant plants have retarded growth phenotypes. The plastids of the mutant line had fewer stromal thylakoids, no grana, less starch grains and more densely stained, globular structures that likely represent plastoglobuli. Moreover, the resultant defects in chloroplast integrity undoubtedly lead to a dramatic decrease in the photosynthetic capacity, which consequently results in smaller plants and lower seed number. At the same time, abnormal chloroplasts and reduced photosynthetic capacity may create a nutritional stress response, which is marked by a significant increase in the anthocyanin levels. This finding is consistent with the observations that anthocyanins are induced by a number of environmental stresses.

AT4G37930 has_phenotype Photorespiratory phenotype: chlorosis at ambient CO2 levels, fully rescued at 3% CO2.
AT4G35090 has_phenotype Photorespiratory mutant that shows a wild-type phenotype when grown at high CO2 (3000-4500 ppm) or in air at irradiance below 30 �mol.m-2s-1. Significantly decreased rosette biomass when grown in air above 100 �mol.m-2s-1 irradiance. Lesions appear in a photoperiod-dependent manner : few or none are observed in 8h photoperiods, even up to 400 �mol.m-2s-1 growth irradiance, while in 16h photoperiods lesion formation is observed at 100 �mol.m-2s-1 irradiance and becomes extensive as irradiance is increased. Despite lesion formation, plants survive to flowering, though final rosette mass and seed production are decreased compared to wild-type.

AT4G33010 has_phenotype When germinated on MS medium in a CO2 concentration close to 1% in combination with moderate light intensity. Under these conditions, which very strongly suppress 2-phosphoglycolate synthesis by Rubisco, several very small plants with whitish leaves and a growth arrest at the cotyledon stage segregated. Shadowing by leaves of neighbouring plants resulted in minor chlorophyll biosynthesis, but growth was not significantly improved.

AT3G47450 has_phenotype rif1-1 mutants are pale green with delayed leaf development. They have a strong resistance to fosmidomycin (FSM), an inhibitor of the isoprenoid biosynthetic enzyme DXR. The reduced rate of degradation of DXS and DXR in rif1-1 mutants leads to a higher accumulation of these two MEP biosynthetic enzymes. Though RIF1 was originally believed to be an NO-synthase, treatment with an NO donor, does not rescue the DXR over-accumulation phenotype, implying that this is not an NO-dependent phenotype. There is a reduction in the level of the large subunit of Rubisco, and two other plastid-encoded proteins in the rif1-1 mutant, however, levels of the plastid-encoded ClpP1 protease are elevated in rif1-1 mutants, compared to wild type seedlings. A plastid-targeted YqeH-GFP construct can rescue the growth, pigmentation, and FSM-resistance phenotypes of rif1-1. YqeH is a GTPase implicated in ribosomal biogenesis in bacteria.
AT2G24270 has_phenotype The rate of CO2 assimilation per unit leaf area is decreased about 40% compared to wildtype plants.

AT3G42170 has_phenotype Seedlings homozygous for the T-DNA insertion completely lacked expression of DAYSLEEPER. Mutant seedlings grew very slowly, and showed no expansion of the cotyledons or development of normal leaves or floral organs. The root remained short and had an excess of abnormal root hairs. The main and lateral root meristems appeared to have a normal organization when young, but as they matured became increasingly disorganized. After prolonged growth on plates, a few seedlings (1%) produced some photosynthetic tissue.
AT1G68890 has_phenotype High chlorophyll fluorescence (hcf) phenotype associated with photosynthetic lesion.
AT5G18660 has_phenotype plae-green phenotype. Growth rate severely reduced compared to wild-type. The thylakoid membranes are arranged in a disorderly fashion and do not develop distinct grana stacks; extensive adhesion of two to a few thylakoid membranes is observed instead. No distinct differences in the size and the number of chloroplasts between wild-type and mutant. Starch granules are not found in the mutant chloroplasts suggesting a reduction of photosynthetic activity.

AT5G65110 has_phenotype Double mutant seedlings were unable to catabolize seed storage lipids and accumulated long-chain acyl-CoAs. The acx1-1 acx2-1 seedlings were also unable to establish photosynthetic competency in the absence of an exogenous carbon supply, a phenotype that is shared with a number of other Arabidopsis mutants disrupted in storage lipid breakdown. Germination frequency of the double mutant was significantly reduced compared with wild-type seeds. This was unaffected by the addition of exogenous sucrose, but was improved by dormancy-breaking treatments such as cold stratification and after-ripening.  Peroxisomes in the cotyledons were enlarged in double mutants, while in single mutants (acx1-1 and acx2-1) peroxisomes were identical to the wild type.
